                    <h3>Retention of Your Personal Data</h3>
                    <p>The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes
                        set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use Your Personal Data to the extent
                        necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain
                        your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal
                        agreements and policies.

                        The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is
                        generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen
                        the security or to improve the functionality of Our Service, or We are legally obligated to
                        retain this data for longer time periods.</p>

                    <h3>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
                    <p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices
                        and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means
                        that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside
                        of Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data
                        protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction. <br><br>

                        Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information
                        represents Your agreement to that transfer.<br><br>

                        The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated
                        securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data
                        will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place
                        including the security of Your data and other personal information.</p>

                    <h3>Delete Your Personal Data</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the Personal Data that We
                        have collected about You. <br><br>

                        Our Service may give You the ability to delete certain information about You from within the
                        Service. <br><br>

                        You may update, amend, or delete Your information at any time by signing in to Your Account,
                        if you have one, and visiting the account settings section that allows you to manage Your
                        personal information. You may also contact Us to request access to, correct, or delete any
                        personal information that You have provided to Us. <br><br>

                        Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal
                        obligation or lawful basis to do so.</p>

                    <h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
                    <h4>Business Transactions</h4>
                    <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be
                        transferred. We will provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes
                        subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <h3>Law enforcement</h3>
                    <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if
                        required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a
                        court or a government agency).</p>
                    <h3>Other legal requirements</h3>
                    <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is
                        necessary to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
                        <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>
                        <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
                        <li>Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public</li>
                        <li>Protect against legal liability</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
                    <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of
                        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We
                        strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot
                        guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
                    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
                        personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or
                        guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please
                        contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the
                        age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information
                        from Our servers <br><br>

                        If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your
                        country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We
                        collect and use that information.</p>

                    <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
                    <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on
                        a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You
